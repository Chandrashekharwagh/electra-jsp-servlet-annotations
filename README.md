# JSP-Servlet Annotations Guide

This repository demonstrates the use of annotations in JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Servlets, providing practical examples and implementations.

## Overview

Annotations in JSP and Servlets simplify Java web application development by reducing XML configuration. This project aims to:
- Illustrate key JSP and Servlet annotations
- Provide working code samples for common use cases
- Serve as a learning resource for developers transitioning to annotation-based configuration

## Contents

1. **@WebServlet Annotation**
   - Basic usage
   - URL pattern mapping
   - Servlet initialization parameters

2. **@WebFilter Annotation**
   - Request filtering
   - URL pattern matching for filters

3. **@WebListener Annotation**
   - Context listeners
   - Session listeners
   - Request listeners

4. **@MultipartConfig Annotation**
   - File upload handling

5. **Other Useful Annotations**
   - @WebInitParam
   - @HandlesTypes
   - @ServletSecurity

## Key Annotations

### @WebServlet

Used to define a servlet component in a web application.

### @WebFilter

Defines a filter component.

### @WebListener

Marks a class as a web application listener.

### @MultipartConfig

Indicates that a servlet can handle file upload.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Servlet 3.0+ compatible web server (e.g., Apache Tomcat 8.x or higher)
- Maven (for dependency management)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Build the project
4. Deploy the generated WAR file to your web server

## Usage

Each annotation example is contained in its own package. To run a specific example:
1. Deploy the application to your web server
2. Access the appropriate URL for the example you want to run
3. Follow the instructions provided in the comments of each example

## Benefits of Using Annotations

- Reduced XML configuration in web.xml
- Cleaner and more maintainable code
- Easier to understand component roles at a glance
- Improved development productivity

## Best Practices

- Use annotations for simple configurations
- Combine annotations with web.xml for complex scenarios
- Keep URL patterns consistent and logical
- Use meaningful names for your servlets and filters
